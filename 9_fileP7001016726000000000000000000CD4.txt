Preface
We are honoured to present the Third Canadian Edition of Campbell BIOLOGY. For the last three decades, Campbell BIOLOGY has been the leading university text in the biological sciences. It has been translated into 19 languages and has provided millions of students with a solid foundation in university-level biology. This success is a testament not only to Neil Campbell’s original vision but also to the dedication of thousands of reviewers, who, together with editors, artists, and contributors, have shaped and inspired this work. 
Our goals for the Third Canadian Edition include:
increasing visual literacy through new figures, questions, and exercises that build students’ skills in understanding and creating visual representations of biological structures and processes
asking students to practise scientific skills by applying scientific skills to real-world problems
supporting instructors by providing teaching modules with tools and materials for introducing, teaching, and assessing important and often challenging topics
integrating text and media to engage, guide, and inform students in an active process of inquiry and learning
Our starting point, as always, is our commitment to crafting text and visuals that are accurate, current, and reflect our passion for teaching biology.
